 Server-side anti-cheat library for socketIO games


<br/>
<br/>

# History
    Created by Stark for the game studio he created

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

# Made For  : 
    SocketIO library "npm i socketio"
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/socketio

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

# Getting Started : 

 Install package : 

    npm i anticheat-socketio

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

# Usage : 

    const anti_cheat = require('anticheat-socketio')



<br/>
<br/>
<br/>


# Overall Goals : 

    - Efficient event-driven integrity events with minimum latency
    
    - pass in game config to configure acceptible game mechanics

    - configure overall settings (ex. max # of concurrent connections, time delays and more)

# Features :
    ðŸ”³ Time between requests
    âœ… # of concurrent connections (socket Vs. address)
    ðŸ”³
    ðŸ”³

# To Detect Goals : 
 - number of concurrent connections
 - initial join package
 - events, movement, items and IO package anomalies
 - more arriving soon

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

# Naming Convention : 
snake_case (yes for all aspects front-end, back-end, packages)

Reasons why : 

1) Readability

2) reduced context-shifting and mental strain
